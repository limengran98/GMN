# Graph Mask Network

This repository is the official implementation of [Graph Mask Network]. 

>ðŸ“‹  In this study, we propose a graph mask network (GMN) method that utilizes a self-generative approach to improve the quality of graphs. The main principle of GMN is the activation of the masked edges of the input graph structure and the reconstruction of the new edges by means of a self-supervised strategy.
